# Inabit Github Profile Repo 

## Development

From the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme):

    If your organization does not already have a public .github repository, 
    create a public .github repository.

    In your organization's .github repository, create a README.md file in the profile folder.

    Commit the changes to the README.md file. The content of the README.md will 
    appear on your organization's public profile.
